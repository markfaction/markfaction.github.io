### About
A software developer with 12+ years of experience and currently engineering team lead at [:Different](https://different.com.au/about/). I discuss and post about various topics related to software architecture, lessons from leading product teams, agility (the trait), dev practices, tech leadership, and data driven thinking.

### Contact
I am mostly active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marksinnathamby/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/markfaction). You can also drop me an [email](mailto:markfaction@hotmail.com), though my responses to email are generally a bit slow.
