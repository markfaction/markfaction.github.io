#### About
Hi, I'm Mark, a seasoned developer and engineering lead with over 16 years of experience. I currently specialize in tools and automation, with a focus on enterprise architecture and test automation. In previous roles, I have worn the hat of a developer, technical consultant, people manager, DevEx advocate, cloud platform engineer, and DevOps engineer. I have worked in startups, scaleups, and fortune 500's, spanning locations across Sri Lanka, Singapore, Japan, Norway, and New Zealand (my current home base). I blog mostly about interesting observations from my work and personal life.

#### Contact
I am mostly active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marksinnathamby/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/markfaction). You can also drop me an [email](mailto:markfaction@hotmail.com).
