Below is a collection of my condensed notes on various topics on computer science, software architecture, and system design, most in a constant state of work in progress. 
I jot them down as a method of off-loading what I learn from various resources and in my daily work, into this 'second brain' as I call it, which serves 
as a digital filing cabinet of sorts.

_If interested in how and why I like to organize my learning as such, you might like to read up on the [Zettelkasten](https://zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/) method, although my approach below
does not follow the specific canonical method. I am heavily inspired by it though._
